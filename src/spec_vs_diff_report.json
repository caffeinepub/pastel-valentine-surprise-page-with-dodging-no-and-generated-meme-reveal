  "summary": "The diff adds a React/Tailwind Valentine page implementation with a reveal view that references the required static meme path and includes pastel theme tokens/animations. However, key requirements cannot be fully verified from the truncated App.tsx, and the required image asset file itself is not present in the added files list. The diff also introduces unrequested Internet Identity/react-query plumbing and an empty backend canister file, which conflicts with the client-only/non-goals intent.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Render the main prompt text as “Be my Valentine Richaa” and show two clearly labeled buttons “Yes” and “No” in a single-screen experience.",
      "reason": "The added App.tsx is truncated before the initial question UI is shown, so the presence of the exact prompt text and the two buttons cannot be confirmed from the provided diff evidence.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Implement the “No” button as an evasive control that repositions on pointer approach/enter (desktop) and on attempted tap (touch), and never triggers a decline state.",
      "reason": "The diff shows state and a moveNoButton() helper, but the event handlers/logic that binds this behavior to hover/pointer proximity and touch interactions is not visible in the truncated App.tsx, so the acceptance criteria cannot be verified.",

        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated)"

    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Add the generated meme image as a static frontend asset under frontend/public/assets/generated/ and render it via a static path.",
      "reason": "The reveal view references the image path, but the actual image file under frontend/public/assets/generated/ is not included in the added files list, so the asset requirement is not implemented/verified by this diff.",

      "description": "Introduced Internet Identity authentication provider/hook and actor-creation hook with react-query invalidation logic.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists authentication/user accounts/persistence as non-goals and states no third-party authentication; it also says using the existing Internet Identity hook is not required. Adding these hooks/providers is extra scope not requested for the Valentine page interaction.",

      "description": "Added a backend canister file (empty actor).",
